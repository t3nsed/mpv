<h1>Tensed's MPV config</h1>

<i>discontinued shortly due to new mpv syntax</i>

This is a slightly modified version of various mpv userscripts, filters, sharders and lua-settings and not optimized for low-end pc playback. The unmodified userscripts can be found here: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/User-Scripts

The Goal of this simple MPV config is to save time of people who do not want to spend time learning how mpv works and simply want good playback quality and nothing more.

<b>Installation</b>

Simply copy all the files and put them in your mpv folder, which can be found in <code>~/.config/</code> for Unix-based OS's. For Windows, search for <code>%appdata%</code> and create a folder named <code>mpv</code> if it does not exist already.

<b>Usage</b>

This config does not include personalized keybinds. <code>stats.lua</code> lets you see Information relevant to the file you are playing if you press the letter <code>i</code> .
